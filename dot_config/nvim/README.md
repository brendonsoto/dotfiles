# Neovim config

## Structure

Nothing new here. My config is the result of combining ideas from different blogs/videos/articles/etc.


## What do I want my Neovim experience to be like?

I think the most important thing is I want to understand what's going on in my
setup.

Next up would be snappy.

Web Dev is a big part of what I do so that's my primary concern.
This includes things like:
- (JS|TS(X?)) LSP support
    - IDEALLY NOTIFICATIONS WHEN THE LSP IS LOADED!!!
- contextual autocomplete
    - I need to refine what this means
- No auto-creating a comment when writing a singular comment
- auto-close html/jsx tags
