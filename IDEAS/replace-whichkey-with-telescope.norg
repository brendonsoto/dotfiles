* Replace which-key with Telescope
  Just learned about `Telescope.builtins.keymaps`
  Makes me wonder if I don't need `which-key`
  I do wonder too, can you add metadata for keymaps you make to make them descriptive?
  _Update:_ Nahhh, I like
  _Update2:_ Going to try again. I think it's more helpful than typing a key and waiting.

  Need to move keymaps around from which-key
  Did so 2022-Nov-27
