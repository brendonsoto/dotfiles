# Rework twerk to have only relevant dirs
  This is for my `twerk` command.
  It prints a list of work directories in `fzf` and the selected one is piped to a `tmuxp` command.

  I currently have it to list out all directories related to work, but I realize a lot of it is noise.
  I'm thinking of going a more simple and naive route by just having a manual list.
  I can't really automate it because of the whole monorepo situation.
