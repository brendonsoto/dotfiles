- markdown:
    - create a templates plugin/gist:
        - looks for a `_templates` folder recursively
        - uses Telescope to show options with previews
        - hitting enter inserts template
        - alternative: create snippets << probably go with this one

    - This isn't great when working on a team that hasn't implemented any
    automatic code formatting
- [https//github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim](https//github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim)
