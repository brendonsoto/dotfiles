I want to be able to take notes via Neovim.
I don't want to use Obsidian or another editor.
Not something that emulates vim but not completely.
It's messing with my brain because of the similarities.

What I want:
- ability to make checklists with statuses of: incomplete, indeterminate (half-filled), complete, cancelled
    - these statuses should have icons
- auto-insertion/continuation of a list
    - for example, here, in markdown, when I hit enter I'm brought to the beginning of the line w/o a dash
- a way to distinguish headers
    - I liked Obsidian since headers could be diff font-sizes. Maybe I can make a plugin where the top row of the editor is reserved and shows what header you're on highlighted the same color as the header. Or a status-line plugin.
- horizontal rules
    - I'll probably have to type these out
