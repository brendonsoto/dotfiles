* CSS Comment in styled components
  Need them as `/* comment */` not `// comment`

  Forget the comments, that was in {:./comments-in-jsx-and-tsx:}
  This would be a TreeSitter thing?
  Try messing with {https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/1111#issuecomment-1216655480}[this]

  The `//` style comments work fine?
