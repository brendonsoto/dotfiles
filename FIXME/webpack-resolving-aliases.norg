* Resolving webpack aliases when using "go to"
  Problem:
  You have a webpack alias and thus have import statements like:
  `import MyComp from '~/components';`
  You have `MyComp` under your cursor and try to "go-to" the definition
  Sometimes that wouldn't happen.
  Of course, now I cannot reproduce it.

  New problem:
  How to resolve webpack aliases when in insert mode when making an import statement
  This makes me think it's a nvim-cmp thing
