# FIX ME

Make sure whatever you're adding here hasn't been [fixed already!](./fixed/index.md)
There's also a [template](./template.md) you can copy and rename for making new issues.

## macOS

   - Rust?
   -- wait until you're using it more regularly
   - script for git worktree?

## Neovim
   - [ ]
