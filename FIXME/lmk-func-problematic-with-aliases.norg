* lmk script problematic with aliases

** Steps to repro
   - Have an alias (struggling to think of one since the one I use is for work), maybe like `alias e="echo 'hey'"`
   - Run `lmk <alias>`

** Fix
   Turn the alias into a function.
   OR
   Make sure whatever the alias is referencing is in the `$PATH`.
   If not and you don't want to add it, reference the absolute path in the alias.
