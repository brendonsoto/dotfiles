* LSP + nvim-cmp
** 2022-Nov-27
   This was occurring the past week too!
   For some reason cmp isn't playing nice with LSP
   I tried having the same setup as on the Wiki
   I'm going to try re-setting it up

   *Fixed!*
   I think I had two conflicting sources
   I wound up integrating one source at a time starting with LSP
   (although this technically involved two sources)
