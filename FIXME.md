# FIXME

## macOS
- Brew installation requires another step now so not sure if I can automate it right away :/
- For Neorg treesitter -- need to make sure the right `gcc` is linked
  - https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/issues/74#issuecomment-906627223
  - at Alloy, had to update the path and version to the homebrew gcc
- Using "Hack Nerd Font Mono" for both macOS and Linux seems fine
- need to trim out Ruby + nvm stuff in place of asdf
- Rust?
